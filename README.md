## 📘 Overview

**Permanent Folder Icon Changer** is a powerful, menu-driven Windows utility that allows you to **change and permanently set custom icons for any folder** on your system.
It automatically handles `desktop.ini` creation, hidden attributes, and instant Explorer refresh — all while ensuring your selected icon file is safely **copied into the folder** (so your custom icon never breaks, even if the source file is moved or deleted).

This tool is a compiled `.exe` version of a batch-based system utility for convenience and reliability.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Permanent Icons:**
Copies the chosen `.ico` or `.exe` icon file directly into the target folder before applying it — ensuring your icons never reset or disappear.

✅ **Multiple Operation Modes:**

* **Browse Mode:** Choose any folder via a GUI picker.
* **Subfolder Scan Mode:** Automatically process all subfolders in a directory.
* **Manual / Drag & Drop Mode:** Paste or drag a folder directly onto the `.exe`.

✅ **Smart Detection:**
Finds `.ico` and `.exe` files within the folder and filters out irrelevant files automatically.

✅ **Automatic Debug Log:**
Every session generates a detailed log at:

```
%TEMP%\_folder_icon_debug.log
```

You can check it for troubleshooting or script behavior inspection.

✅ **Context Menu Integration (Optional):**
Install a **“Change Folder Icon”** entry in the **right-click context menu** for quick access.

* Works for both folder background and direct folder right-clicks.
* Uses a permanently stored icon in `C:\Windows\System32` for persistence.
* Requires **Administrator privileges** to install or uninstall.

✅ **Robust Design:**

* Handles spaces, special characters, and Unicode in paths.
* Auto-fallback if `FolderIconUpdater.exe` is missing or fails.
* Clean user prompts and progress feedback.
